### Project Overview:

We are constructing a 3-minute video deep-diving into three established AI tools that instructors are already leveraging in the classroom (across a variety of grade levels) to pitch the utility of AI-assisted education in the classroom. Those 3 tools are ALEKS (tailored lesson generation for individual students), Carnegie Learning (AI-powered math tutor), and Gradescope (an AI-assisted grading tool).
